/*

Create a chat bot which can respond to a few basic text inputs.

Here is an example conversation:

Bot: Hi! What is your name?

User: My name is _____.

Bot: That's a great name! How are you today?

User: Great!

Bot: Nice to hear!

Note: The bot should reply with words as appropriate to the context.
If the user responds with "Not well" to the "How are you" question,
then the bot should not respond with "nice to hear"

Second note: the .contains() method is a great way to check whether
a string has a certain substring (word) inside of it.

You can choose more questions & customize its responses.

The conversation should take place in the console.
